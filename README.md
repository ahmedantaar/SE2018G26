"Your Museum" 
Online museum is a web site that help people who canâ€™t afford to visit real museums to see, appreciate, and learn from different kind of arts from around the world, and the site also provide an online opportunity for museums, amateur artists, professional artist to display their art work and monuments, and the site also provide a service where users can buy and sell their art work.

There is a problem while uploading the website to hosting server beccause so there is no link and we tried to communicate with Dr. Mohammed Sobh and Eng. Amr so we hope we can deliver it offline.

Github Issue: 
Before the last upload we faced a lot of merge issues so we decided to just delete the whole client and upload it again fresh.
